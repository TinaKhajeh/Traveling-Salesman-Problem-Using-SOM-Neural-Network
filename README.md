Traveling Salesman Problem Using SOM Neural Network
=========================================================


In this project, well-known traveling salesman problem solved using Self-Organized Map(SOM) neural network. An important part
of the project is related to the initialization method and parameter adaptation law since beside solving the problem,
achieving better results and faster convergence is another goal.
